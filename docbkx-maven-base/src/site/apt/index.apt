One Minute Introduction

  This project provides some base to be used as the foundation for
  plugins generated by the Maven Docbkx Builder Plugin. Basically,
  these base classes contain all relevant behaviour. The Maven Docbkx
  Builder Plugin will mainly add accessors, fields and implementations
  of some abstract methods.
